This is a number game between two players where each player is to choose a random integer between one and ten inclusively equal number of times. With total initially being zero, the numbers chosen by one player are subtracted from total and the numbers chosen by the other player are added to total(The player decides if he wants his numbers to be subtracted or added to total but they cant carry out the same operation). The sign of total after these arithmetics determines the winning player. If total is a negative number, the player that carried out subtraction wins and if total is positive, the player that carries out addition wins.
